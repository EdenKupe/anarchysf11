## anarchySF

AnarchySF is an online archive of the intersection between anarchy and science fiction. This archive is an open-source repository of anarchist or anarchy-adjacent science fiction. Featured on the site are books, movies, and other media which are either anarchist in their politics or of interest to anarchists.

This archive was first collected and organized by [Ben Beck](http://benbeck.co.uk), who gathered and maintained it for the better part of four decades (!) As of 2019, it was redesigned and re-built by Eden Kupermintz and Yanai Sened as a collaborative effort.

Built with [the LibDoc template](https://github.com/ita-design-system/eleventy-libdoc) and running on [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/).
