---

Well-received fantasy novel. Not actually sf by any definition recognised here, but listed because it was the subject of one of the accompanying <a href="https://creators.spotify.com/pod/show/anarchysf/episodes/Grounding-ourselves-in-Saint-of-Bright-Doors-e2k41fs/a-aba5n1e">anarchysf</a> podcasts. It was also reviewed by Joseph-Kass Tomaras in _The Anarchist Review of Books_ #8.
