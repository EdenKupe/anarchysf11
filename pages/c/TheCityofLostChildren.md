Demented scientist kidnaps children to steal their dreams,  but finds inevitably that they only have nightmares. Surreal, oneiric steampunk.

Included in Glenn's 'Film as Subversion', in _The BASTARD Chronicles_, where it is described  as "a dadaist steam-punk fantasy [. . .]" which "leaves the viewer wondering,  'What is Normal'?"
