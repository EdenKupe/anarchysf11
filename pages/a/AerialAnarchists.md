title: "Walter R. Booth - Aerial Anarchists"
---

15 minute short featuring an airship attack on London. Believed to have been based on Fawcett's <em>Hartmann the Anarchist</em>. No footage is known to survive. For Tony Shaw (see bibliography), the film "can be seen as early evidence of film-makers' ability to marry terrorism with images of mass destruction."

Included in the CIRA filmography (see bibliography).
