Included in Nettlau's _Esbozo de Historia de las Utop√≠as_, where it's simply described as antisocialist. It's actually worse than that, really a dystopia cast in the traditional mode of a utopia. The society described is one of relentless grey uniformity, with life compulsorily terminated at sixty. I found myself thinking of North Korea.
