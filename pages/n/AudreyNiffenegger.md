title: "Audrey Niffenegger - The Time Traveler's Wife"
---

Appealing romantic fiction in which the time traveller has a genetic condition which causes him involuntarily to jump around his own timeline, while true love surfs over this fragmented chronology. One or two minor characters lean towards anarchism.
