One of the principal anarchist publishing houses with a significant number of <a href="https://pmpress.org/index.php?l=product_list&c=61&show=100">sf publications</a> to its name. A particular favourite is their _Outspoken Authors_ series of short author profiles, each of which is likely to include short stories, an essay, an interview with the author, and a bibliography. They also publish original SF, such as recent works by Otter Lieffe and Nick Mamatas.
