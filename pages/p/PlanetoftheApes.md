_Fifth Estate_'s reviewer, Thomas Haroldson, admired <a href="https://www.fifthestate.org/archive/55-june-4-18-1968/planet-of-the-apes/">this film</a>, on its release, much more than he did the same year's _2001._ He concluded that "In many ways, 'Planet of the Apes' is nothing less than a comprehensive condemnation of the entire present-day civilized world. On the surface, the picture is merely an enjoyable flick, but at heart it is a serious filmâ€”and a pretty damn good one at that!"
