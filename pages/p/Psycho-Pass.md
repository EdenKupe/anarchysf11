Much the most interesting anime you'll find here. The series might be described as an ambiguous dystopia, set in a 22nd century Japan. It looks thoughtfully at the big questions of freedom and justice, and what degree of personal autonomy it might be acceptable to sacrifice in the interest of the wider community. On top of that it's superbly animated.
