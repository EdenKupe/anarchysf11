A worthwhile, progressive, and mostly optimistic anthology, this book was enthusiastically reviewed in 2021 by <a href="https://anarchiststudies.org/envisioning-futures-a-review-essay-by-maia-ramnath/">Maia Ramnath</a> for the Anarchist Studies website. She summed it up as "a wondrous collection of speculative fiction from a starry group of writers with an unfailingly high level of language and invention."
