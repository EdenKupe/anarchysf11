One of the appealing PM Press Outspoken Authors series. A _Locus_ review by Gary K. Wolfe was republished on the <a href="https://www.anarchistfederation.net/the-presidential-papers-by-john-kessel-review-by-gary-k-wolfe/">
Anarchist Federation</a> website, probably because the concluding short satirical sketch 'A Brief History of the War with Venus' is particularly pertinent given the current political situation in the US.
