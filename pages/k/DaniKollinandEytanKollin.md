title: "Dani Kollin and Eytan Kollin - The Unincorporated Man"
---

Depicts a 24th century world in which everyone is literally an individual corporation, in which they themselves may be just one shareholder among many. A 21st century character is revived from cryonic storage, and as the only unincorporated human is able to inspire a global revolution, to overthrow this system.

Winner of the 2010 Prometheus Award. Easterbrook (see bibliography) devotes a page to this novel and its sequels, seeing the style as quite Randian, and the economy as of the libertarian school that argues that 'pure' or 'true' capitalism has not yet been tried.
