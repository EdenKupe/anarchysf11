title: "FÃ©lix Bodin - The Novel of the Future (first published as Le roman de l'avenir)"
---

Important to the history of sf, but otherwise of little interest now.

Included in Nettlau's <a href="biblio.htm#Nettlau: Esbozo">_Esbozo_</a>, as one of the more characteristic non-socialist views of the future, while noting that Bodin was a French deputy.
