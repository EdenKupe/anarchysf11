Acclaimed and successful re-envisioning of a poor 1978 series of the same name.

Post-anarchist academic Lewis Call has written two papers on this series: 'Crisis of Authority Aboard the Battlestar Galactica,'Â in <em>New  Perspectives on Anarchism</em> (2010) ed. Nathan J. Jun and Shane Wahl; and 'Death, Sex and the Cylon: Living authentically on Battlestar Galactica,'  in <em>Science Fiction Film and Television</em> vol. 5, no. 1 (2012). Neither is  readily available.
