Short piece of utopian speculation, described by <a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/bacon_francis">SFE</a> as "a  remarkably accurate assessment of the potential of the scientific renaissance."

Citing this work, Bob Black (see bibliography) describes Bacon as "technology's first enthusiast." Berneri devotes eleven pages to the piece.
