title: "Vanessa Veselka - Zazen"
---

Personal ruminations on what to do in a near-future dystopian America verging on war. The <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/678115/zazen-by-vanessa-veselka/">publishers</a> quote Cara Hoffman, founding editor, <em>The Anarchist Review of 
Books</em>:

“<em>Zazen</em> is revolutionary. Gorgeously written, deeply intelligent, explosive, it is a vicious and nuanced takedown of the neo-liberal state, and the reactionary, identity-besotted left that opposes it. 
As forests burn and cities are gentrified and billionaires launch themselves into space, there is no better time for this story of terror and joy and the intoxicating freedom of resisting authority in all its insidious guises. Veselka is a genius, an outsider philosopher for the ages.”
