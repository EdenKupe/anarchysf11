Pleasing YA novel: essentially a whodunnit set in a post-catastrophe California. The world 100 years hence is largely peaceful and agrarian, with an exchange economy and no power hierarchy, although rural communities have administrative committees, and there are specialist investigators who seek resolution in the rare cases of individual transgression (in this case a suspicious death). Not obviously anarchist, but one sort of society that might evolve in an anarchy.
