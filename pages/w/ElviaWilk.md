title: "Elvia Wilk - Oval"
---

In a near-future Berlin, a couple move into an eco-housing community on an artificial mountain. One of the partners invents a drug ('Oval') that promotes generosity, with a view to using it to counteract inequality. All doesn't quite go to plan.

A whole episode of the <a href="https://anchor.fm/anarchysf/episodes/Oval---Is-Reciprocity-in-Our-Nature-etf0lm">anarchySF</a> podcast is devoted to this novel.
