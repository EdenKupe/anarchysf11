_The Aerodrome_ is a rather earnest farce concerning  a sluggish rural village and a hyperefficient neighbouring aerodrome, examining  the fascination of authoritarianism. George Woodcock found this political allegory  "ultimately more satisfying than any of Kafka's." (Woodcock 1948)
Â 
_The Wild Goose Chase_ is also  discussed, noncommittally, in Woodcock 1948.
