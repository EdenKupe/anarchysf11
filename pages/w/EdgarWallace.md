The second in the author's _Four Just Men_ series. Principally melodramatic crime fiction, but this instalment has yet another anarchist airship bombs London clich√©, with the endearing twist that it's 
brought down by trained hawks pecking holes in the airship fabric. The anarchists are part of a movement called the Red Hundred, their leader (also unusually) a charismatic woman.
