title: "John Adolphus Etzler - The Paradise within the Reach of all Men, without
  Labor, by Powers of Nature and Machinery: An Address to all intelligent men, in
  two parts"
---

Etzler's remarkable work — noted in Nettlau's <em>Esbozo</em> (see bibliography) — is, though not fictional, a forward-looking utopian prospectus quite astonishingly prescient in its championing of sustainable energy in the form of wind, tidal, wave, and solar power generation, as the key to future prosperity.
