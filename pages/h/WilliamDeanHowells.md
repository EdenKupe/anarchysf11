title: "William Dean Howells - A Traveler from Altruria"
---

The eponymous traveller gently mocks American society,  while refraining from describing his own Christian socialist utopian land until  the final chapter.
Â 
Noted by Bob Black (see bibliography) for its  three-hour obligatory working day. Included in Nettlau's _Esbozo_ and in the _Red Planets_ list of recommended reading (see Bould, in bibliography).

Howells was also notable for having written publicly to express his outrage at the prosecution of the Haymarket martyrs in 1887. See Garlin's <a href="https://archive.org/details/WilliamDeanHowellsHaymarket/mode/2up">_William Dean Howells and the Haymarket Era_</a>.
