title: "W.H. Hudson - A Crystal Age"
---

_A Crystal Age_ is a far-future matriarchal utopia,  pervaded with a cloying sweetness-and-light.
Â 
Herbert Read read all of Hudson's books at the end of  World War I, and according to George Woodcock Hudson was a significant influence  on Read's _The Green Child_. Marie-Louise Berneri was also familiar with  this utopian romance, though she found Hudson's "sexless society"  unattractive. (Berneri 1949, Woodcock 1972b)
