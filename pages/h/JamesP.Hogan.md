_Voyage from Yesteryear_ describes an attempt by Terrans to recolonise a planet settled by humans some years before, in which the authoritarianism of the new colonists is thwarted by the libertarianism of the old. The planet's social system is essentially anarchy, but details are not dwelt upon.  For <a href="http://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/"> Zeke Teflon</a>, though, it features "a setting directly derived from  Murray  Bookchin’s _Post-Scarcity Anarchism_." The plot is largely derivative of Russell's  '. . . And Then There Were None', and the book doesn't improve on that story in any respect. The novel is also mentioned approvingly by Randall Amster, in his 2009 'Anarchy, utopia, and the state of things to come' (Amster et al., eds _Contemporary Anarchist Studies_: 299).

This and _The Multiplex Man_ were both Prometheus Award winners.
