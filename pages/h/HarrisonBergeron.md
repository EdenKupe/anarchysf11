Made for TV, and based on the Vonnegut short story, but  considerably reworked. Good, but the 2009 version (entitled  _2081_, q.v.), which reverted to the original, is  appreciably better.
Â 
Osborne (see bibliography) reviewed the film  enthusiastically (but before _2081_ came out):  "For a cinematic attack on enforced equality, you could hardly do better than  this wonderful film. [. . .] This is a moving and stimulating experience, and  one of the most dead-on libertarian films ever made."
