A giant fire-breathing amphibious dinosaur is aroused from  the deep by undersea nuclear testing, and wreaks havoc on land, before being  despatched with a secret weapon.
 
Described by Mark Bould in his _Red Planets_ filmography (see bibliography) as a "Mournful, pacifistic,  anti-nuclear monster movie."
