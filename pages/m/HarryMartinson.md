---

Influential epic poem recounting the voyage of the spaceship _Aniara_, knocked off course by an asteroid, condemning the thousands on board to eventual death.

Martinson's first wife, Moa (n√©e Swarts), to whom he was married for eleven years, was an anarchist. She met Harry while both were writing for the Swedish left/anarchist magazine _Brand_.
