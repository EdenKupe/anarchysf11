Fourth and hopefully last in the series, not adding a great deal. Alex Prichard, in the 2022 edition of Anarchism. A Very Short Introduction, comments, of the first three Matrix films, that ". . . you will struggle to find a more successful anarchist franchise than these. All four films explore the relationship of man to machine questions of freedom and domination, of identity and humanity."
