title: "Drew Hayden Taylor - Take Us to Your Chief and other stories"
---

Collection of First Nations sf, of which the title story receives a two-page discussion in Jesse Cohn's 2024 _Hot Equations_. Cohn notes that "It's easy to see that Taylor is poking fun at the whole drama of the First Contact conceit, with its colonial overtones, but at the same time, he is sabotaging romanticized versions of the _indian_ as a noble people, stoic in their own tragic 'vanishing,' etc."
