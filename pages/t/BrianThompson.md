title: "Brian Thompson - The Anarchists"
---

Confusing and barely readable tale of time travel and parallel realities. Has next to nothing to do with anarchism or anarchists, apart from one mention of the latter word on the final page, and the use, throughout, of the circle A as a section divider.

Avoid.
