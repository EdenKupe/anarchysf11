title: "John C. Shannon - The Dream of Jacques, the Anarchist"
---

Lurid Victorian melodrama—mercifully short (2½ columns of Victorian newsprint)—in which a grossly caricatured villainous anarchist hitman dreams of future war, flying in an airship and dropping his new and devastating explosive on the army below, then fantasising about becoming ruler of the world.
