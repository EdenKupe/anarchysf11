title: "Richard Henry Savage - The Anarchist. A Story of Today"
---

Although John Clute, in <a href="https://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/savage_richard_henry">SFE</a>, describes this work as of sf interest, it really isn't. There's nothing science fictional about it, beyond it being set in a future very close indeed to 1894: Victoria is still on the British throne, and in the author's view "the three greatest men of the day" are Gladstone, Bismarck, and Pope Leo XIII.

The work is primarily a lurid romance, with the usual cardboard cut-out anarchists.
