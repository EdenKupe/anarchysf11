---

_Fuzzy Nation_ is a re-envisioning of H. Beam Piper's *Little Fuzzy*. A fine comic SF novel, highly recommended by Zeke Teflon at the [See Sharp Press blog](https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2015/11/27/recommended-science-fiction-books-as-holiday-gifts/).

<a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2018/12/12/review-the-consuming-fire-by-john-scalzi/">Teflon</a> included _Redshirts_ in the same category, noting that "since Sheckley, Scalzi is unquestionably the best comic sci-fi writer".
