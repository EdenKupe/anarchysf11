A <a href="https://www.seesharppress.com/index.html">publication house</a> that in recent years has principally focused on anarchist, atheist, and science fiction titles. It's especially noteworthy for its blog 
page, authored by 'Zeke Teflon', on <a href="https://seesharppress.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/anarchist-science-fiction-favorite-novels/">Anarchist Science Fiction: Essential Novels</a>, which (regrettably) hasn't been updated since 2019.
